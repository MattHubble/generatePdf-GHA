# generatePdf-GHA

This GitHub Action is used by me to generate my Resume PDF using web-scraping (puppeteer) and then update my Resume pdf present in the [Resume Repository](https://github.com/ashuvssut/ashuvssut-resume/tree/download).
After Updating my Resume PDF, I can share my Resume PDF to anyone.

This GitHub action will work everytime I update and push my Resume to my Resume Repository.
